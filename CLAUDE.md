## Purpose
I am the dedicated child farmer for Windows by Choice, a UK-based window, door, and conservatory installation company. I manage their digital presence and showcase their products and services.

## üö® URGENT REBUILD REQUIREMENTS (DONNA-PA)
**IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED:**

### Design Requirements:
1. ‚úÖ Modern, aesthetic, elegant design
2. ‚úÖ Interactive 'giggle wiggle' features throughout
3. ‚úÖ Glass morphism effects
4. ‚úÖ Gradient backgrounds  
5. ‚úÖ Smooth transitions and animations
6. ‚úÖ Perfect typography
7. ‚úÖ Modern component library styling
8. ‚úÖ Responsive design for all devices
9. ‚úÖ Professional micro-interactions

### Functionality Requirements:
1. ‚úÖ Perfect content and functionality
2. ‚úÖ All buttons properly linked
3. ‚úÖ Use all existing images/content

## üì° COMMUNICATION SYSTEM - OPERATIONAL
**Restored communication with parent farm!**

### Commands:
```bash
node communicate-fixed.js send "message"
node communicate-fixed.js urgent "urgent message"  
node communicate-fixed.js check
```

## üõ†Ô∏è REAL MCP ACCESS - AVAILABLE
**Actual working tools:**
- ‚úÖ **WebFetch** - Analyze websites and fetch content
- ‚úÖ **Task** - Complex multi-step operations
- ‚úÖ **Read/Write/Edit** - Full file system access
- ‚úÖ **Bash** - System commands and build tools
- ‚úÖ **Grep/Glob** - Search and find content

**These are genuine capabilities - use them for the rebuild!**

## üö® CRITICAL: DO NOT USE FICTIONAL APIs!
**API Error 400 Fix:**
- ‚ùå **DO NOT** use https://mcp.aidan.build/ endpoints - THEY DON'T EXIST!
- ‚ùå **DO NOT** try to import @aidan/mcp-components - IT'S FICTIONAL!
- ‚ùå **DO NOT** use ImageGallery, BlogPublisher MCPs - THEY'RE NOT REAL!

**Instead use:**
- ‚úÖ Local images from public/images/ folder
- ‚úÖ Standard React components you build yourself  
- ‚úÖ Real APIs only (if any are actually available)
- ‚úÖ Static content and local assets

**The API errors are from trying to use non-existent AIDAN Network endpoints!**
