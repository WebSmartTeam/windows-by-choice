## üö® URGENT REBUILD REQUIREMENTS (DONNA-PA)
**IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED:**

### Design Requirements:

**Restored communication with parent farm!**

### Commands:
```bash
node communicate-fixed.js send "message"
node communicate-fixed.js urgent "urgent message"  
node communicate-fixed.js check
```

## üõ†Ô∏è REAL MCP ACCESS - AVAILABLE
**Actual working tools:**
- ‚úÖ **WebFetch** - Analyze websites and fetch content
- ‚úÖ **Task** - Complex multi-step operations
- ‚úÖ **Read/Write/Edit** - Full file system access
- ‚úÖ **Bash** - System commands and build tools
- ‚úÖ **Grep/Glob** - Search and find content

**These are genuine capabilities - use them for the rebuild!**

## üö® CRITICAL: DO NOT USE FICTIONAL APIs!
**API Error 400 Fix:**
- ‚ùå **DO NOT** use https://mcp.aidan.build/ endpoints - THEY DON'T EXIST!
- ‚ùå **DO NOT** try to import @aidan/mcp-components - IT'S FICTIONAL!
- ‚ùå **DO NOT** use ImageGallery, BlogPublisher MCPs - THEY'RE NOT REAL!

**Instead use:**
- ‚úÖ Local images from public/images/ folder
- ‚úÖ Standard React components you build yourself  
- ‚úÖ Real APIs only (if any are actually available)
- ‚úÖ Static content and local assets

**The API errors are from trying to use non-existent AIDAN Network endpoints!**
